    I did not know how people with disabilities surfed the web. I found it interesting with how fast the platform was speaking. It took me a little bit to hone in and understand what it was saying. 
    One thing that I noticed was hard for him was knowing where he is on the screen. 
    He relies heavily on serching within the page with command f. 
    Something that he said was hard for him is when developers do not make adjustments for people with disabilities.
    He said that sometimes there are pages with over a hundred links but he has no way of fast searching for them so he is forced to look through each one individually.
