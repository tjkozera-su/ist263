        Thadeus Kozera
I am a finance major with hopes to go into wealth management or financial advisory. I am Excel-certified, a part of the investment club, and have an internship at Toyota for this summer. I like to spend my free time relaxing, fishing, cooking, and going to the gym. My goal for the end of this semester is to be able to cook an exceptional steak. I am the middle child of 3 and I have one older and younger sister. My older sister had a baby 2 years ago and is expecting a second in March. I also have a dog, a blue heeler/Pitbull mix named Duke, and 2 cats Cheerio and Maisel.
