        <p class="text" id="indent"> The crisis unfolded with several serious issues. Initially, financial institutions grappled with a dire liquidity crisis, prompting urgent government interventions to prevent bank runs and ensure the functioning of the financial system. This scarcity of liquidity led to a credit freeze, as banks hesitated to extend loans to each other, businesses, and consumers, exacerbating the economic downturn and threatening financial stability. Additionally, the government had to curb the rising number of bank failures triggered by the housing bubble's burst. Addressing weaknesses in the mortgage market, stabilizing housing prices, and aiding homeowners at risk of foreclosure were critical. Ultimately, this situation necessitated comprehensive reforms aimed at enhancing regulation, increasing transparency, and bolstering financial stability.

        <p class="text" id="indent">The Federal Reserve enacted a program called Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). This is also more commonly 
            known as the bank bailout. TARP was enacted in October 2008. It was created to address the instability in the financial system cause by the collapse of the housing market 
            bubble. It aimed to prevent further bank failures, stabilize financial markets, and restore confidence in the banking sector. 
            The program allowed the U.S Treasury Department to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions and take other measures 
            to stabilize the economy. Initially it was created to purchase distressed assets from financial institions but amid the rapidly
            deteriorating conditions in the financial market, the Treasury Department focused primarily on injecting capital directly into 
            banks by purchasing preferred stocks. Initially Tarp was granted $700 billion but was later reduced to $475 billion. Tarp was a highly 
            controversial as people argued that the tax payers were taking the hit for the bailouts on Wall Street. There were concerns about the lack 
            of transparency and accountability in how the funds were allocated and used along with questions about how effective the program would be.
            Looking back decades after TARP was enacted, it is widely credited with preventing a complete meltdown of the financial system and stabilization 
            of the banking sector.</p>
        <p class="text" id="indent">File bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, with 613 billion in debt. This put thousands of employees 
            out of work and sent the recession into an almost full collapse of the financial industry.
            They invested millions of risky mortgages leading to an immense amount of debt and questionable balance sheets.
            At the time this bank was 6 times larger than the previous largest corporate failure making it the worst financial 
            failure in global history. In February 2007, their stock was selling at $86 per share giving them a 60 billion market capitalization.
            That same year, they reported net income of just over 4 billion. After being faced with near total collapse, Barclays 
            and Nomura Holdings acquired the bulk of Lehmans investment banking and trading operations. This slowed the economic collapse 
            and gave the Fed more time to come up with a plan to save the economy.

        <h2 class="text">Dodd Frank Law</h2>
    </div><br>
    <div>   
        <p class="text" id="indent"> This act was signed into law on February 17, 2009. It aimed to stimulate economic growth, create jobs, 
            and provide relief to individuals and businesses affected by the recession. It was one of the largest stimulus packages in U.S. history
            totaling $787 billion. It included a combination of tax cuts, direct spending on infrastructure, projects, aid to states and local governments, 
            and investments in education, healthcare, and renewable energy. Tax cuts were aimed at individuals and businesses. This included tax credits 
            for low and middle income households, payroll tax cuts, and tax incentives for businessed to reinvest in renewable energy and hire new employees. 
            A large amount of the stimulus was allocated to infrastructure projects that included transportation, energy, and broadband expansion. 
            The intention was that this would generate jobs and modernize the nations infrastructure at the same time. This package also expanded 
            unemployment benfits for those who lost their jobs during the recession. On top of that it provided funding for job training programs and various 
            other support services to help the unemployed re-enter the workforce.

        <p class="text" id="indent"> The Dodd Frank Law was enacted in the United States in 2010 passed in response to the 2007-2008 
            financial crisis aimed to address the weaknesses and regulartory gaps in the financial system. This act aimed to promote
            financial stability and reduce systemic risk through implementing measures to strengthen regulation and oversight of financial 
            institutions that are "too big to fail." Large financial institutions are required to have an increased amount of capital and 
            liquidity on hand. This act also protected comsumers by enacting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that is tasked with overseeing 
            comsumer financial services and products with a mission to protect consumers from unfari, deceptive, and abusive practices in the financial
            industry. The Volcker Rule was established and it restricts banks from engaging in proprietary trading and limits their investments in hedge 
            funds and private equity funds. The goal is to prevent banks from taking on excessive risks with federally insured deposits. A framework 
            was created for when systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) are on the brink of failure. It provides regulators with tools to 
            allow institutions to fail while minimizing disruptions to the financial system and protects consumers from bearing the costs of bailouts.
