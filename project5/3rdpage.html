        <h2 class="text">Too Big To Fail Banks</h2>
        <h2 class="text">Why Can't We Break Up The Big Banks?</h3>
    </div><br>
    <div>    
        <p class="text">"Too big to fail" (TBTF) banks are financial institutions that are considered so large and interconnected with the financial 
            system that their failure could pose a massive risk to the economy. Their downfall could have cascading effects on the financial markets, leading 
            to widespread disruptions, economic downturns, and systematic risk. Some key characteristics of banks that are too big to fail include: Size, 
            interconectedness, complecity, and systemic importance. TBFT banks are among the largest financial institutions in terms of assets, deposits, 
            and amrket capitalization. They also have excessive global operations and a significant presence in mukltiple sectors of the industry. These 
            banks are also very connected with other institutions internationally and domestically. They have very complex corporate structures and business 
            models spamming across multiple financial sectors. These banks have immense systemic importance because their failure could cause severe 
            consequences pertaining to the stability of the financial system and the economy. TBTF banks are a heated debate among economists as they 
            can create moral hazard through incentivising excessive risk-taking while relying on government support if something goes wrong. 
            </p>
        <p class="text">
            There are a handful of reasons why it would be difficult to break up the too big to fail banks. First is their interconnectivity. 
            They are complex institutions with diverse lines of business and extensive global operations. To break them up, you would ahve to unravel 
            complex corporate structures, separating different business units, and address interconnected relationships with other financial institutions 
            and markets. This is a grueling process that has technical challenges and could disrupt the functioning of financial markets and economy. 
            The second issue is that TBTF banks operate on a global scale. To break them up we would have coordinate and cooporate with international 
            regulators and policymakers. There are also a lot of uncertainties that go with breaking up these banks. They could have unintended 
            consequences and risks like fragmentation of financial markets, reduced economies of scale and efficiency, smaller institutions would be more 
            vulnerable to financial shocks. The US financial industry become less efficient by offering fewer services at a higher cost.

        <h2 class="text">Moral Hazard</h4>
        <h2 class="text">Perverse Incentives</h5>
    </div><br>
    <div>
        <p class="text"> Moral hazard is When one party takes on more risk, because another party will bear the burden of that risk. The perception that 
            certain banks are too big to fail is the embodiment of moral hazard. During the financial crisis, banks and other financial institutions 
            took on excessive risk, knowing that they can rely on governemnt support or bailouts if they faced financial distress. This led to risky 
            lending practices and excessive leverage. The main problem was through subprime lending. The years leading up to the financial crisis, lenders 
            practiced aggressive subprime mortgage lending thorugh extending loans to borrowers with poor credit histories. They justified these poor 
            investments with the belief that the risky loans could be passed onto investors through securization. The idea that you can pass problems onto 
            the next person is a prime example of moral hazard and ultimately led to the cause of the crisis. In order to prevent another situations 
            like The Great Recession, we need to remove as much moral hazard from the financial sector as possible. This is why currently too big to fail 
            banks are highly debated among economists. 
            </p>
        <p class="text"> Perverse incentives are incentives that unintentionally encourage individuals to engage in behavior that is harmful or  
            counterproductive to the intended goals of a system. In the context of the financial system, perverse incentives contribute to risky 
            behavior, moral hazard, and systemic instability. During the financial crisis there were multiple perverse incentives at play. The first is 
            compesation practices. Incentive structures within financial institutions often rewarded short-term gains and excessive risk-taking, without 
            adequate consideration of long-term consequences. Compensation practices, such as performance bonuses and stock options, incentivized traders, 
            executives, and other employees to prioritize immediate profits over prudent risk management. This encouraged aggressive lending, speculation, 
            and the creation of complex financial products with little regard for the underlying risks. The second is with credit rating agencies. They 
            are paid by issuers of securities they rated, creating a potential conflict of interest. This incentivized rating agencies to provide favorable 
            ratings to complex financial instruments, such as mortgage-backed securities in order to maintain relationships with issuers and generate revenue. 
            These inflated ratings misled investors about the true risks of these securities, contributing to the buildup of systemic risks. By limiting the amount 
            of perverse incentives circulating around the economy will put the economy on the right track to avoid another meltdown.

        <h2 class="text">Economists Disagree</h4> 
    </div><br>
    <div>
        <p class="text">Currently, economist disagree on what to do about too big to fail banks for various reasons. Some economists argue that 
            TBTF banks benefit from scales of economies allowing them to provide a wider range of services at a much lower cost than if they were 
            broken up into smaller banks. However, others argue that the potential benefits have to be weighed against the systemic risk that these banks pose.
            Economist differ in how the assess systemic risk that TBTF banks pose. In highly concentrated markets where a few large banks dominate, breaking up TBTF 
            banks could promote competition, innovation, and consumer choice. However, in more competitive markets with a diverse array of institutions, the benefits of 
            breaking up TBTF banks may be less clear. The structure of financial markets and competitive landscapes also influence economists view on 
            breaking up TBTF banks. Some believe that these banks are inherently risky due to their size, complexity, and interconnectedness, and that 
            breaking them up would reduce the likelihood of future financial crises. Others argue that systemic risks can be managed through enhanced 
            regulation, supervision, and resolution planning, without the need for drastic measures such as breaking up banks.
