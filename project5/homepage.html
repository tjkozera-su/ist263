        <h2 class="text">What was the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis?</h2>
        <h2 class="text">Cause of The Great Recession</h2>
    </div><br>
    <div>    
        <p class="text" id="skip"> The financial crisis was a severe economic downturn that originated in the United States mortgage market. Subprime mortgage rates and aggressive lending
            of loans led to many financial institutions failing and going bankrupt. It was the largest economic downturn since The Great Depresssion. During and after the crisis, the government stepped in providing 
            bailouts, creating programs like TARP, Dodd Frank Law, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to help stabilize the economy and restore trust in the financial system.
            The crisis also spread globally due to the interconnectivity of the global financial system. The rapid spread to other countries started a worldwide economic downturn. 
            </p>
        <p class="text">It was triggered by a combination of factors, including the housing bubble burst, subprime mortgage crisis, and excessive risk-taking by financial institutions.
            Prior to the crisis, there was a rapid increase in housing prices fueled by easy credit conditions and speculative buying. When home prices started to decline in 2006, 
            it triggered a wave of mortgage defaults, particularly in the subprime mortgage market. Subprime mortgages, which were issued to borrowers with poor credit histories, 
            became increasingly common in the years leading up to the crisis. As home prices fell and interest rates rose, many borrowers were unable to refinance their mortgages 
            or sell their homes, leading to a surge in foreclosures and a collapse in the value of mortgage-backed securities. Because of this, Many banks and financial firms 
            experienced significant losses and were forced to declare bankruptcy or seek government bailouts to avoid collapse.</p>

        <h2 class="text">Federal Funds Rate Increase</h2>
        <h2 class="text">Construction Boom</h2>
    </div><br>
    <div>
        <p class="text">From 2004-2006, the FED raised the federal funds rate from 1% to 5.25%. What this did was make it more than 5 times more expensive per month. This started a wave 
            of foreclosures as borrowers were no longer able to pay off their loans.
            Many people who accepted subprime mortgages didnâ€™t understand the complexity of their loans</p>
        <p class="text">Fueled by excessive speculation, subprime mortgage lending, and a subsequent burst of the housing bubble. Once the bubble broke it led to a variety of problems. 
            Some of these problems include; foreclosure and abandonment of properties, government infrastructure projects, commercial real estate, and renovation and rehabilitation. By the end of the 
            recession, at least 5 million construction workers lost their jobs. </p>

        <h2 class="text">Subprime Mortgages</h2> 
        <h2 class="text">Credit Default Swaps (CDS)</h2>
    </div><br>
    <div>
        <p class="text">Subprime mortgages are home loans extended to borrowers who have poor credit histories. During the years leading up to the financial crisis, subprime mortgages became 
            increasingly common as lenders relaxed their lending standards and offered loans to borrowers who may not have qualified for traditional mortgages. During the years leading up to the financial 
            crisis, subprime mortgages became increasingly common as lenders relaxed their lending standards and offered loans to borrowers who may not have qualified for traditional mortgages.
            Before the mass lending of subprime mortgage rates there was a housing boom fueled by easy credit conditions and speculative buying. Lenders were eager to extend mortgages to a broader 
            range of borrowers to capitalize on the booming housing market. Mortgage lenders bundled together groups of subprime mortgages and sold them as mortgage-backed securities to investors. 
            This process, known as securitization, allowed lenders to offload the risk of default onto investors, thereby freeing up capital to originate more loans. This caused a problem of moral hazard as lenders continuously
            passed risk from one to another. In the early 200s, the Federal Reserve set low interest rates whihc encouraged borrowing. Many borrowers took advantage of the low initial rates on adjustable-rate mortgages to purchase homes.
            Once the rate was increased many of them were unable to pay off their loans leading to a massive amount of foreclosures. </p>
        <p class="text">Credit default swpas are financial derivatives that allow investors to buy protection against the risk of default on a particular debt obligation, such as a bond or loan. In a credit default swap contract,
            the buyer of protection makes periodic payments to the seller of protection. They played a significant role during the financial crisis for a couple reasons. The first is the complexity and uncertainties of credit default swaps. 
            It was difficult for investors, regulators, and even financial institutions themselves to assess and manage risk effectively. This lack of transparency contributed to uncertainty and heightened market volatility during the crisis.
            CDS are bilateral contracts between two parties, which means that each party is exposed to the credit risk of the other. The interconnectedness of financial institutions through credit default swaps meant that the failure of one 
            institution could have cascading effects on others, leading to systemic risk and contagion in the financial system. CDS played a critical role in the collapse of Lehman Brothers. They had a significant exposure to CDS tied mortgage-backed 
            securities and other risky assets ultimately leading to massive losses and liquidity problems. </p>

        <h2 class="text">Failure of Banks and Bailouts</h2>  
    </div><br>
    <div>
       
            <p class="text">This photo is a graph of sharp increase of bankrupcy filings from January 2006-December 2008. This 
             graph is a great visual representation on how fast businesses were failing and the scope of the cripling economy.
             The increase in bankrupcy filings was caused by the construction boom, federal funds rate increase, subprime
             mortgages, and credit default swaps.</p>
         
            <p class="text">    There were a toal of 140 banks that failed in 2008 and 2009. The costliest bank failures include:
            Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers  Bear Sterns was a Global investment bank and 
            financial services firm located in New York City. Bear Sterns main problem was their exposure to subprime mortgages and securities. When 
            the housing bubbles burst, mortgag defaults surged causing the value of their assets to plummit leading to substancial losses. 
            In March 2008, they faced a severe liquidity issue caused as rumors of its solvency spread. This caused clients and investors to 
            withdraw their funds at a rapid rate. Eventually the Federal Reserve had to step in. They provided significant funding
            to try and keep them afloat but there was too much damage already. They helped facilitate Bear Sterns sale to JPMorgan Chase 
            at a significantly discounted price. They were acquired at a price of just $10 a share which is down 94% from their 52 week high. <br>

                The Lehman Brothers were a global financial services firm also headquarted in New York City. Much like Bear Sterns, they
                were hit hard by exposure to subprime mortgages leading to massive losses. They eventually failed to raise enough capital 
                to meet its short-term funding needs as counterparties grew increasingly weary about their solvency issues. They searched 
                for various rescue option like seeking a buyer and capital injection from an investor but unfortunatley came up short. They 
                reached out to Barclays and Bank of America but both parties walked away from negotiations. They were not as lucky as Bear Sterns 
                because even the Government refused to provide a bailout. This led to them filing for chapter 11 bankrupcy protection 
                on September 5th, 2008. At the time this was the largest bankrupcy filing in U.S history. The failure of Lehman Brothers caused
                a great deal of shock and panic throughout the financial industry and accelerated the financial crisis as it sparked a wave of
                bank failures and government interventions. Due to the massive reprocussions of their failure, policymakers around the world
                scrambled to stabilize financial markets through bank bailouts, liquidity injections, and fiscal stimulus packages to restore 
                confidence and support the economies recovery.
